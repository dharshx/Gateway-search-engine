# Gateway Search Engine

This is a web application that allows users to search for information on various topics using multiple search engines simultaneously. It was built using React and CSS.

The code follows a modular architecture, with separate modules for indexing, searching, querying, and UI components.

This allows for easy customization and extension of the search engine's functionality.

The code uses advanced indexing techniques such as sharding, which distributes the index across multiple machines to improve search performance, and caching, which stores frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval.

These techniques help improve search performance and scalability.

# How to Navigate this Project

1. public folder: contains the HTML and CSS files for the application.
2. src folder: contains the JavaScript files for the application.
3. src/components: contains the React components used to build the application.

# Why I Built the Project this Way

I built this project using React because it allows for fast and efficient development of complex user interfaces. 

Additionally, React's component-based architecture made it easy to manage and reuse code throughout the project.

I used CSS for styling because it provides a flexible and powerful way to customize the look and feel of the application. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
